# HabberMan Data Analysis

Haberman data analysis explores breast cancer survival, focusing on patients' age, operation year, lymph nodes, and survival status. It aims to predict outcomes and uncover survival patterns using statistical methods.

## Univariate Analysis 
### Age:
Average: 52.5 years
Range: 30 to 83 years

### Year of Operation (year when surgery was performed):
Average: 1962.85 (spanning from 1958 to 1969)

### Positive Axillary Nodes:
Average: 4 nodes
Maximum: 52 nodes

### Survival Status:
1) Survived 5+ years: 225 patients
2)  Did not survive 5+ years: 80 patients

## Bivariate Analysis (Relationships Between Two Variables)

### Correlation with Survival Status:
1) Positive nodes have a positive correlation (0.29) with survival status.
2) Age and survival status show a weak positive correlation (0.06)


## Multivariate Analysis (Patterns Across Multiple Variables)

1) Patients with fewer positive nodes and younger age tend to survive longer.
2) Older patients with more positive nodes are more likely not to survive.
3) Age 34 shows higher node averages for non-survivors compared to survivors.
